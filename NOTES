Issues
======

1. Sort by X

  - In library items: sort subitems by name, date, etc.

  - In image list view: sort images by name, date, etc. [done]

  Both kinds of sorting should persist across restarts.

2. Dragging library items

  - Dragging a top-level item should move it in the view.

  - Dragging a subfolder should move it in the file system.

3. Rename folders in library view by editing their name.

4. Allow image metadata to be edited

  - Title, caption, copyright, keywords etc.

  - Allow image names to be changed?

  - Dedicated tagging/keywording UI? (Panel showing tag list, with
  those that are applied sorted forwards and highlighted?)

  - Edit orientation state for simple rotation support. [done]

5. Overlay metadata badges in image view

  - Ratings etc..

6. Command to select RAW vs JPEG source file

7. Custom image list filters

  Normal "build a query" style UI (use NSPredicate and its editor).

  RESOLVED: implemented. But may create a better editing UI later,
  NSPredicateEditor is somewhat clunky.

8. Save filters/queries as smart folders in source list

  The position of the filter item in the library hierarchy controls
  what it filters. E.g. top-level == filter everything, subitem of a
  directory == only filter that directory.

  Once created, selecting the smart folder item activates the
  associated image list and predicate. Opening the predicate editor
  shows the current filter, but editing the predicate doesn't
  immediately commit the changes back to the smart folder. Only once
  the OK button has been clicked will the smart folder's permanent
  state be updated, cancelling returns it to the original state.

9. "Preview" mode where the fullsize image isn't loaded?

10. Viewer should be able to display multiple images?

  As an option? Useful for comparing similar images.. or does it just
  make the images too small to be useful? Perhaps a way of quickly
  flipping through the selection like a stack of cards? (With a
  view-all mode for selecting?)

10. Image groups (aka stacks)

  - Allow multiple images to be grouped

  - The stack can be reordered, the first is used by default

  - Stacks can be expanded to show all images, or collapsed

  - Command to create stacks based on time brackets?

11. Duplicate an image

  - i.e. create a new meta file referencing the same master image(s)

  - not too useful yet, but will be later, e.g. multiple crops of the
  same image

12. Archive volumes

  Mark a directory as the "archive" of a library root. Then:

    - command to move unused files (RAW vs JPEG etc) to the archive,
    - may also copy used files into the archive, for completeness.

  After moving the assets around need to create valid metadata in the
  archive location, and update the metadata in the master to add a
  reference to the "missing" file, probably its name and hash, so that
  it can be found when needed. (The metadata already lists the kinds
  of files that are available, but it may not be saved.)
